# Gillette Venus - Design of a data driven Marketing Plan
Creation of a marketing strategy aimed at boosting sales of the "Gillette Venus" razor in physical stores during the peak summer months. The strategy is based on the results obtained from machine learning techniques to predict future sales and clustering techniques to find the "ideal store" on which to focus marketing efforts.

The notebook `notebook.ipynb` contains all the data analysis that we carried out.
It exploits some classes and functions we developed in the `modules` folder, in the files named as `dataset.py` and `regressor.py`. The `utils.py` file contains some utility functions.

The enriched dataset is called `definitivo.csv` and it is stored in the `data` folder.
